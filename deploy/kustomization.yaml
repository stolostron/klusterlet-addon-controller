# Each entry in this list must resolve to an existing
# resource definition in YAML.  These are the resource
# files that kustomize reads, modifies and emits as a
# YAML string, with resources separated by document
# markers ("---").
#
# General rule here is anything deployed by OLM bundles should go here as well,
# this is used in "make deploy" for developers and should mimic what OLM deploys
# for you. CRDs are an exception to this as we don't want to have to list them all
# here. These are deployed via a "make install" dependency.
